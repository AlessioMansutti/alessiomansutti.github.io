    <hr>
    <p>
        Separation logic is a mathematical formalism for reasoning about pointer programs. 
        Among the various features of this logic, reachability predicates have a special status, as they allow to express crucial properties of the memory such as acyclicity and garbage-freedom. In this project, we study the complexity and expressiveness of separation logics featuring reachability predicates.
