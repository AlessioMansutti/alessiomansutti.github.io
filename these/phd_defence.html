<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<p>
This thesis proposes an in-depth study of classical decision problems, such as satisfiability and
validity, for separation logics: well-known assertion languages developed to verify sequential
and concurrent programs with dynamic memory allocation. The main features of separation
logics are given by two binary connectives: the separating conjunction 
<math style="letter-spacing: -5px;">&lowast;</math>&nbsp;
and the separating
implication <math style="letter-spacing: -5px;">&#9472;&lowast;</math>&nbsp;. 
These two connectives use second-order features in order to express spatial
properties, and allow the verifier to modularly analyse the memory.
</p>

<p>
The first part of the thesis focuses on the notion of reachability predicates in separation
logics. A location <i>l<sub>1</sub></i> (a.k.a. a memory address) is said to be reachable from a 
second location <i>l<sub>2</sub></i> whenever subsequent dereferentiation of <i>l<sub>2</sub></i> 
yield <i>l<sub>1</sub></i>. Together with first-order quantification,
reachability predicates allow to check for several robustness properties of the memory, such as
acyclicity (i.e. the absence of cycles) and garbage freedom (i.e. the absence of dangling pointers).
Our goal is to devise a separation logic featuring these types of predicates, while keeping the
complexity of its satisfiability problem in check. This is easier said than done, as we show
that several separation logics are largely intractable (undecidable or non-elementary decidable).
Nonetheless, by studying the sources of intractability we are able to design a PSpace fragment
of first-order separation logic that is able to express the desired robustness properties. The
PSpace membership is shown through the core formulae technique, a model theoretic approach
that is reminiscent of Gaifmanâ€™s locality theorem for first-order logic.
</p>

<p>
The second part of the thesis tackles the open problem of designing Hilbert-style 
axiomatisations for separation logics. An axiomatisation is said to be Hilbert-style (or internal) 
whenever its axioms and inference rules are built solely from formulae of the logic, without any 
external machinery such as labels or nominals. In particular, we introduce the first sound and 
complete internal proof system for the quantifier-free fragment of separation logic. The completeness 
of the system is shown by taking advantage of the core formulae technique introduced in the first
part of the thesis. In order to show that this technique can be reused on other logics, we design
an axiomatisation for a modal logic enriched with the composition operator from ambient logic
(a logic to verify distributed systems). The two proof systems reveal interesting connections
between separation logics and ambient logics.
</p>

<p>
Motivated by the similarities in their proof systems, in the third part of the thesis we dig deep
in the connections between separation logic and ambient logic. To carry out our comparison, we
devise a suitable framework based on modal logic. This framework gives us the common ground
needed in order to study the two logics from the point of view of their spatial connectives: the
separating conjunction 
<math style="letter-spacing: -5px;">&lowast;</math>&nbsp;
for separation logic and the parallel composition for ambient logic.
Surprising similarities and differences are discovered, both in terms of expressive power and
computational complexity.
